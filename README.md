# reactjs-freecodecamp-tutorial

This repository contains four basic projects developed with ReactJS.

These are very simple projects that contain basic React knowledge such as Props, Hooks, Functional Components, Events and others.

If you want to execute any of these projects, do the following:
- Have NodeJS installed on your computer.
- Go to the project you want to run and open a terminal.
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
If your native language is Spanish I leave you the link to the basic course,
it is very well explained and is a good start to learn React.
